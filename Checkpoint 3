We worked on Grover’s algorithm on a quantum computer to search for obscured passwords. We started with a basic version using 2-qubits to search for a previously-specified password (“11”) and then progressed to a version able to search for any 3-bit password such as “101,” “000,” or “111.” Our circuit layout contained an oracle that indicated the proper password by phasing, and a diffuser that increased the odds in getting the right answer. We varied the number of iterations (repeats) in testing the algorithm in order to observe the effect on the success rate, and we repeated the circuit in order to provide data for various passwords. 

The early findings are that Grover's algorithm is best for running the optimal number of times—the 3-bit password algorithm for running 2 iterations. The algorithm for running for far too long, however, makes the success rate fall because of the variation in the odds naturally. We learned from all the above that iterations do count for Grover's performance, and when well done, the algorithm always reveals unique passwords but at the same speed. Future directions include scaling our method for 4-bit passwords, predicting the effect of noise and errors in the circuit, and pitting our quantum findings against a classical brute-force search for an estimate on the number of practical advantages in running the quantum technique.
