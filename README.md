Research Question
Can Grover’s algorithm find a hidden password faster than a regular computer trying every possible guess, and how does noise in a quantum computer affect its success?

Overview
This project shows how Grover’s algorithm, a special quantum method, can guess a password faster than classical methods. Instead of testing each password one by one like a normal computer, Grover’s algorithm uses quantum effects to check many possibilities at once and needs only about the square root of the total guesses.

We will use Google Cirq, a tool that simulates quantum computers on a regular computer, to build and run this quantum password search.
